This repository contains my B. Tech thesis titled "Charger design for light electric vehicles" that I worked on as an undergraduate at IIT Kharagpur

# Abstract
The aim of this project is to design an efficient charger for light(3kW) electric
vehicles. We are in a new era of transportation, where cleaner cars (that are also
affordable) are not a thing of imagination. Electric vehicles are being treated
essential for the sustainability and development of human society. The charger,
being an essential component of the vehicle, demands a good design.

The charger has two stages; the first stage is a PFC (Power factor correction) rec-
tifier followed by an isolated buck converter (PSFB : Phase-shifted full bridge).
The rectifier ensures power factor close to 1 at the input side, which helps us
ensure lower losses and also smaller current rating outlet at the input side. The
PSFB converter ensures controlled current output to the battery while also pro-
viding isolation for protection of either side due to any fault.

All simulations have been done using PSIM.

All programming has been done on NXP microcontrollers.
